###About Me

I find there's something to enjoy in all things, so naturally, I like lots of things.

When I'm not building web applications, outdoor activities like skiing, climbing, backpacking and sailing prodvide a healthy dose of challenge and adventure. I draw inspiration from live music, videogames and books. I also love a heathly debate to grow and learn.

Like so many things in life, the whole is often greater than the sum of parts, so I like to just keep adding good parts... and maybe few good beers too!
