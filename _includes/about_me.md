###About Me

I think there's something to enjoy in all things, so I tend to like a lot of things.

When I'm not building web applications, I love outdoor activities that provide a healthy dose of challenge and adventure like skiing, climbing, backpacking and sailing. I also have an unending appetite for live music, video games, books and anything else that inspires creativity and great experiences.

Like so many things in life, the whole is often greater than the sum of parts, so I like to just keep adding good parts!
